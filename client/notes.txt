- - use mock
- - How to filter MongoDB request?


Multi session
- Set up multi session object in database.
- Add some session ids.
- Make page on web
- - show map
- - Show participating sessions
- - (Show participating users?)

Also need to fix pushing from the phone app


Alternatives in connecting:
 Instead of API key, could use realm with a user that can only read data. That could be useful. 
- 


What needs to be done:
- Set up a backend server with express. To handle data collection from MongoDB (hide the api key)
- There was something about a special line for heroku to build the client after upload. 
- Need to set some environment variables in heroku for API access


Backend data functions: 
When pushing a session, there should be some general summation objects that are updated as well. 
Useful for data displays, so as to not need to download all the data and count on client side.
