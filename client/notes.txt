What needs to be done:
- Set up a backend server with express. To handle data collection from MongoDB (hide the api key)
- There was something about a special line for heroku to build the client after upload. 
- Need to set some environment variables in heroku for API access


Backend data functions: 
When pushing a session, there should be some general summation objects that are updated as well. 
Useful for data displays, so as to not need to download all the data and count on client side.
